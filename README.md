# vagrant-ubuntu2004srv-aarch64
A basic vagrant box development and deployment for Ubuntu server 20.04 for aarch64 (Arm 64 bit)

# Building the box

## Standard installation
I downloaded the Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS image for ARM here : https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm

I built a virtual machine for libvirt (see **libvirt.xml** (the CDROM used for installation is missing)) and proceeded to installation, following the vagrant guide: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes/base.

## Keeping eth0

The recent ubuntu distributions rely on the newer predictable network interface naming scheme but vagrant insists on having its first interface named "eth0".

Therefore I needed to disable the new naming scheme.

This is a kernel option that is inserted in __/etc/default/grub__:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="net.ifnames=0"
```

Then rebuild the initramfs:
```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Extracting the disk image

I then extracted the resulting virtual disk image to a local sparse file:
```
qemu-img convert -O qcow2 /home/vm/pool/ubuntu20.04-aarch64.qcow2 ./box.img
```

## Putting it all in a box
### Nope
I then had the very bad idea of following the vagrant-libvirt "Create Box" instructions (https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt#create-box) which use their own "create_box.sh" tool.

The problem is that this tool creates a default Vagrantfile that is useless to this image...

It's better to follow these: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/222907/471682 or basically the ones below.

### Yeap

I prepare my own Vagrantfile (see below) and metdata.json.

Then I pack them together in a box file:
```
tar cvzf ubuntu2004-server-aarch64.box ./metadata.json ./info.json ./Vagrantfile ./box.img
```
or faster:
```
tar cv -S --totals ./metadata.json ./info.json ./Vagrantfile ./box.img | pigz -c > ubuntu2004-server-aarch64.box
```

And added the box to my local vagrant:
```
vagrant box add ubuntu2004-server-aarch64.box --name ubuntu2004-server-aarch64
```

# Using the box

For some reason I don't understand yet the vagrant init command pulls a standard Vagrantfile instead of the one I put in the box...
```
vagrant init ubuntu20.04-aarch64
```
